# Now

### 🏢 Work

I'm currently a technical lead at [Culture Amp](https://cultureamp.com), where I lead a small team working in a Rails monolith and across many microservices. Previously I worked with the wonderful humans of [Icelab](https://icelab.com.au) on a wide range of interesting and valuable projects.

### 🕸️ Web

I have been working on building this site to act as a repository for all my nonsense online, and as a way of encouraging me to write more!

It's built using [Hanami 2](https://hanamirb.org), and conforms to the [MicroPub spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/). I've named it _Adamantium_ — partly for my Mum and partly for super strong metal ;)

Where possible, I will try and post as much as I can here, and then syndicate out to services like Mastodon, but you can also find me on:

### 🌱 Life

I currently live in Canberra with my partner and [our dogs](https://instagram.com/barkly_and_crumpet). We've been here since 2015, it's great. You should visit.

In my spare time I like to tinker on various Ruby projects (including the software that powers this blog), make things with [Processing](https://processing.org), explore the various [hiking trails](/hikes) around Canberra and potter around [in the garden](/tagged/garden).

### 🥅 2023 Goals

- 25 Hikes
  - Tracking these as I remember on [this page](/hikes).
- Adamantium
  - ✅ Build a blogging tool that I actually use. 
  - Clean things up and open-source the code — I'm currently using some un-released features of Hanami, so keen to bring in the officially supported stuff before sharing.
  - ✅ Build in a photo gallery to post pages.
  - ✅ Add a way to syndicate after a post is published.
  - Add places visited to weekly posts.
  - Add weather history to weekly posts.
