# About

Hi, I'm _Daniel_. 

I've been in the software / web industry for around 10 years. I'm currently a technical lead at [Culture Amp](https://cultureamp.com), where I lead a small team working in a Rails monolith and across many microservices. Previously I worked with the wonderful humans of [Icelab](https://icelab.com.au) on a wide range of interesting and valuable projects.

I currently live in Canberra with my partner and [our dogs](https://instagram.com/barkly_and_crumpet). 

In my spare time I like to tinker on various Ruby projects (including the software that powers this blog), make things with [Processing](https://processing.org), explore the various walking tracks around our house and potter around in the garden.
